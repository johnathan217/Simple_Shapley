# Simple_Shapley

Calculates the distribution of surplus produced by a coalition of workers and a factory owner in a specific scenario using Shapley values.
Shapley values are the only payment rule satisfying the following four properties: they are efficient, in that the sum of the Shapley values of all agents 
equals the value of the grand coalition; they are symmetrical, in that two equivalent actors are treated equally; they are linear, in
that the gains of two combined coalitions correspond to the gains of the individual coalitions; and the value of a null player is zero.
